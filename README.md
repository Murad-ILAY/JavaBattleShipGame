Battleship is a popular board game involving 2 players. The aim of the game is for the players 
to place their ships on a grid and then guess the positions of their opponents’ ships.
In the program, initially, the battleships will be placed on a 10x10 grid randomly, players will then proceed to guess 
where the ships are on the board. If they guess correctly, they ‘hit’ the battleship, otherwise 
they ‘miss’. The objective of the game for both players is to find and sink all the battleships 
on the board. The player who hits more ships than the other, wins after all ships have been 
destroyed.
While writing the program followings are considered:
- Functional correctness 
- Sound OOP design 
- Clean, tidy and commented code
